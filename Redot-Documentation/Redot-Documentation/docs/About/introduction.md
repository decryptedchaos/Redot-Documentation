Welcome to the official documentation of **Redot Engine**, the free and open source
community-driven 2D and 3D game engine! Behind this mouthful, you will find a
powerful yet user-friendly tool that you can use to develop any kind of game,
for any platform and with no usage restriction whatsoever.

This page gives a broad overview of the engine and of this documentation,
so that you know where to start if you are a beginner or
where to look if you need information on a specific feature.

## Before you start

The [Tutorials and resources ](../Community/tutorials.md) page lists
video tutorials contributed by the community. If you prefer video to text,
consider checking them out. Otherwise, [Getting Started ](../Getting Started/introduction/index.md)
is a great starting point.

In case you have trouble with one of the tutorials or your project,
you can find help on the various [Community channels ](https://redotengine.org/community/),
especially the Redot [Discord ](https://discord.gg/redot) community.

## About Redot Engine

A game engine is a complex tool and difficult to present in a few words.
Here's a quick synopsis, which you are free to reuse
if you need a quick write-up about Redot Engine:

    Redot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D
    and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of
    common tools, so that users can focus on making games without having to
    reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a number of
    platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows),
    mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms and consoles.

    Redot is completely free and open source under the [permissive MIT license ](doc_complying_with_licenses). No strings attached, no royalties,
    nothing. Users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code.
    Redot's development is fully independent and community-driven, empowering
    users to help shape their engine to match their expectations.

## Organization of the documentation

This documentation is organized into several sections:

- **About** contains this introduction as well as
  information about the engine, its history, its licensing, authors, etc. It
  also contains the [doc_faq](doc_faq).
- **Getting Started** contains all necessary information on using the
  engine to make games. It starts with the [Step by step ](toc-learn-step_by_step) tutorial which should be the entry point for all
  new users. **This is the best place to start if you're new!**
- The **Manual** can be read or referenced as needed,
  in any order. It contains feature-specific tutorials and documentation.
- **Contributing** gives information related to contributing to
  Redot, whether to the core engine, documentation, demos or other parts.
  It describes how to report bugs, how contributor workflows are organized, etc.
  It also contains sections intended for advanced users and contributors,
  with information on compiling the engine, contributing to the editor,
  or developing C++ modules.
- **Community** is dedicated to the life of Redot's community and contains a list of
  recommended third-party tutorials and materials outside of this documentation.
  It also provides details on the Asset Library. It also used to list Redot
  communities, which are now listed on the [Redot website ](https://redotengine.org/community/).
- Finally, the **Class reference** documents the full Redot API,
  also available directly within the engine's script editor.
  You can find information on all classes, functions, signals and so on here.

In addition to this documentation, you may also want to take a look at the
various [Redot demo projects ](https://github.com/redot-engine/Redot-demo-projects).
