# Redot Engine documentation

This repository contains the source files of [Redot Engine](https://redotengine.org)'s documentation, in Markdown.

This is a rewrite of our documentation website, and is a transition from Sphinx over to a custom solution in ASP.NET Blazor.

The site is still under heavy construction and is not ready yet, but we hope to have it online before the release of Redot 26.2-stable.

## Development

### IDE
There are no detailed build instructions at this time. The use of an IDE such as Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider is highly recommended. Simply build the solution and run the `Redot-Documentation` project.
The docs themselves can be found in the `Redot-Documentation/docs/` folder, and are just standard markdown files.

---

### CLI
For running from the CLI, you can build and run with the following commands:
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run --project Redot-Documentation/Redot-Documentation.csproj
```
Note that after you have built the project at least once, you can skip the `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build` steps.

---

### Docker
We plan to add a docker file soon for those that want to preview their changes that either don't have the .NET 10 SDK installed or that just want to work on the markdown and not touch the ASP.NET code.
